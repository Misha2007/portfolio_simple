          I am Mykhailo Drogovoz, 18 y.o, and currently I am a student at Tartu
          Vocational School in a software development faculty. I've been
          studying here for the past three years. Prior to this, I spent one
          year studying at a school in Tartu Descartes School before enrolling
          in vocational school. Before moving abroad, I attended gymnasium
          Kyiv-Mohyla Collegium in my home country. I decided to become a
          software developer because this speciality opens a lot of
          opportunities and you can be as creative as you want. My first
          experience with coding came through a website building course and
          after working on a few projects, I realized that software development
          was the perfect field for me. The more I learned, the more I felt
          motivated to continue pursuing this path. Even though I haven't
          participated in official competitions yet, I took part in Hack Club's
          Neighborhood program. The goal of the program was to build a project
          over 100 hours and potentially get invited to San Francisco. Although
          the project was closed before I could complete it, I received valuable
          feedback from testers and learned a lot through the process. Outside
          of programming, I enjoy playing volleyball and ping pong. I also like
          to play the guitar in my free time; it's a great way to relax and
          express creativity in a different way. Thank you for visiting my
          portfolio, and feel free to explore my work!
